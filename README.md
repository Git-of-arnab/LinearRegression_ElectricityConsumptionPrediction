# Electricity consumption prediction by AC in various parts of the world!
Prediction of electricity consumption by an air conditioner, based on multi-variate feature inputs from various cities of the world.\


**Technical Stack used:**
* Data cleaning & pre-processing: python, pandas, sklearn polynomial features.
* EDA & Feature Engineering: ordinal encoding, correlation matrix, standard scaler, pandas, sklearn library.
* Regression Model: Linear Regression
* Accuracy achieved: ~81%

**Project Utility**
* In this project we analysis the various features which are affecting the electricity consumption in various parts of the world
* Furthermore, the prediction results also helps us identify how we optimize various feature to enable the customer for efficient use of AC
* The dataset is divided further into 3 regions -- Europe & Africa, American sub-continent and Asia to have a prudent analysis of the data
* Seaborn and matplotlib is used to visualize the feature dependencies and the important factors affecting the electricity consumption. Some of it is provided below.
